NoDB Blog is a small php web system that simulates a real blog, but without using a database (small study project).

The main goal for this project was to study how to implement PHP elements inside the HTML.

All the posts showed in the homepage are alocated in a PHP archive. Then, the HTML requires all that as variables, and show to the final user.
