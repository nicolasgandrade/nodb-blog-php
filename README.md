NoDB Blog is a small php web system that simulates a real blog, but without using a database (small study project).

<hr>

The main goal for this project was to study <b>how to implement PHP elements inside the HTML.</b>

All the posts showed in the homepage are alocated in a PHP archive. Then, the HTML requires all that as variables, and show to the final user.
