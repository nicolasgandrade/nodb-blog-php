NoDB Blog is a small php web system that simulates a real blog, but without using a database (small study project).

<hr>

The main goal for this project was to study how to implement php elements inside the html.

All the posts showed in the homepage are alocated in a php archive. Then, the html requires all that as variables, and show to the final user.
